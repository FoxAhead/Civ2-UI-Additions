This patch is adapted from civ2patch project.

Purge input buffer interval is the time to wait until the game purges all buffered user inputs. A low interval eliminates temporary lock ups during long AI turns.

Input wait time is the amount of time to sleep when waiting for user inputs. Higher wait time decreases CPU usage, but may introduce input lag.

Input wait time threshold is the period of time with no user inputs before increasing the sleep time.

Input processing time threshold is the time taken to process user inputs before increasing CPU usage. Lower threshold can reduce input lag during heavy processing.">
